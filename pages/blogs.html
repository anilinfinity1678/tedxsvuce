                        TED, as it reads Technology, Entertainment, and Design - is a nonprofit organization performing live talks dedicated to the spread of ideas empowered by knowledge at its absolute core. It caters to varied talking points in terms of the fields it deals
                        with, which can be extendable to any possible abstraction from experiences worth sharing. However, at the same time, each experience shared is highly specific to the motive and concrete about the content of the subject. Talks intended
                        with purpose and information are what inspired TED to bring it to the ground and the people.

                        All of this may sound too heavy and intense for a first-time listener but here comes the fun part - it's NOT! One may end up binging TED talks when they just want some food for thought for the field of their choice. And the best part is, that, one can
                        always explore.
                        <br /> So, why is it fun? <br /> It’s fun because TED talks come with a character - of its speaker and the speaker’s story, place, and incidents involved. Hence, one ends up knowing a lot more than they would expect. It’s a perception
                        of all aspects of an anecdote and one genuinely gets driven by the direction of the story, and what was intended as a big or small tangible change is served.

                    TED, when independently organized by a group of organizations, community, or an institution is licensed as TEDx. As much as it promises autonomy, such events continue to adhere to the principles of an ideal TED talk. It’s not only diverse but also spreads
                    the reach
                    <br />. The essentialities of independent TED is devoted to speaking to a specific community, that are a conglomeration of people representing the same ideas of work, education, interests, or belongingness from a region. It is meant
                    to highlight voices within and around the community catering to mutual notions. The event revolves around a theme such that it is responsive to the majority of the audience.
